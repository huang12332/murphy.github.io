#	PySpark performance optimize 
###	wca mv_ac, mv_pty srz delta tables contains a large number of small files ,i t wasn't merged into a few of big files since 2023 year
###	data source module from ETL had srz.sql.filter select from srz table where ifw_effective_date between start_date and end_date, 
###	when the filter query execute on the wca source tables, it last upto 9 hours to finish the query 
###	 comment out the srz.sql.filter, and write sql 
`select from srz table where ifw_effective_date <= as_of_date and (ifw_effectitve_end_date = 0 or ifw_effective_end_date > as_of_date)` , 
the filter would not read the data file before 2023 years, thus the query run within 20 mins completely
